## About Me

I'm **Hitesh Sharma**, an AI Engineer & Systems Architect with 8+ years of experience across the full stack — from fine-tuning LLMs to scaling Kafka pipelines processing millions of events daily.

### What I Do

- **Generative AI & LLMs**: Building agentic AI systems with frameworks like Agno and LlamaIndex, designing RAG pipelines with Qdrant and Pinecone, and fine-tuning models with VLLM and llama.cpp.
- **Backend & Scalability**: Architecting services with FastAPI and Node.js, orchestrating with Docker and Kubernetes on GCP GKE, and processing 5M+ events/day with Apache Kafka.
- **Databases & Search**: Deep MongoDB optimization expertise, Postgres, vector databases (Qdrant, Pinecone), and search engines (Algolia, Apache Solr).
- **System Architecture**: Leading architecture design for cybersecurity platforms, mentoring teams on production-ready code practices.

### About This Blog

This is where I document my dev experiences — the wins, the debugging rabbit holes, and the architectural decisions that shaped the systems I've built. If you're working with AI systems, distributed backends, or just enjoy reading about engineering challenges, you're in the right place.

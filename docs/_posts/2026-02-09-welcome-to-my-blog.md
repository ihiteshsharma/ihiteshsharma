## Hello there!

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Hitesh Sharma — an AI Engineer and Systems Architect with 8+ years of experience building things that (mostly) work in production.

This blog is where I'll be sharing my dev experiences, learnings, and the occasional war story from the trenches of:

- **Generative AI & LLMs** — RAG systems, agentic architectures, fine-tuning adventures
- **Backend & Scalability** — FastAPI, Kafka, Kubernetes, and the art of handling millions of events
- **System Architecture** — Design decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned the hard way
- **Databases** — MongoDB optimization, Postgres patterns, vector databases

## Why this blog?

After years of solving interesting problems, I realized the best way to solidify knowledge is to write about it. Plus, future-me will thank present-me for documenting all those obscure fixes.

Stay tuned for posts on building production AI systems, scaling backends, and everything in between.
